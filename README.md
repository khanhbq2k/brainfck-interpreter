# brainfck-interpreter

This is a Java-based interpreter for the esoteric programming language called Brainfuck. Brainfuck uses a set of eight commands to manipulate a tape of cells, with each cell containing a single byte of data.

The interpreter is capable of reading Brainfuck code from a file or directly from a string or a file, and outputs the program's results to the console.
